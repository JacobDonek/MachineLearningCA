Hello, welcome to my first Github repository! 

Here you can find supporting files that do not necessarily belong in the CA submission, but can be accessed in case of emergency. :) 

What can you find here? 

- Old versions of my code.
- My written notes taken during the process of this CA.
- A HTML export of my python code with outputs.
